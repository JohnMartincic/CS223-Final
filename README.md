# How to build
You will need a compiler 
I used the MinGW complier
    [MinGW] (http://www.mingw.org/)
    
Program was buit with the CodeBlocks IDE
    [CodeBlocks 16.01] (http://codeblocks.org/)
    
# Run time Errors?
Is the file 'cars.txt' located in the same directory as 'martincic_final_cs223'?

# Credit Due
  [MinGW] (http://www.mingw.org/) for the compiler.
  
  [CodeBlocks] (http://codeblock.org/) for their IDE.
