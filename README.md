Final Project for CS-223 Coding in C at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Fall 2016

# Version

    README.md -> This file

    car.txt -> Same car list

    martincic_final_cs223.c -> c file containing project

# cars.txt Structure
file should be listed as
    
    driverName carType carNumber carColor
    
Program will only accept four cars, but can be expanded by changing the following variables
   
    AUTOCARS, MANUAL, & CARLIST

Also, need to expand the player choice switch statment within the following function
    
    manualRace();

# Features
Single Player Auto mode or Two player Manual mode

Manual mode has a vehicle selection screen and requires input to move

Auto mode runs a race with 4 of the random vehicles from the "cars.txt" file, with an example file included in the directory

Will print results to another text file

# How to build
You will need a compiler 
I used the MinGW GNCC 4.9 x32 complier (default install with codeblocks)
    
   [MinGW] (http://www.mingw.org/)
    
Program was buit with the CodeBlocks IDE
    
   [CodeBlocks 16.01] (http://codeblocks.org/)
    
# Run time Errors?
Is the file 'cars.txt' located in the same directory as 'martincic_final_cs223'?

# Credit Due
  
   [MinGW] (http://www.mingw.org/) for the compiler.
  
   [CodeBlocks] (http://codeblock.org/) for their IDE.
